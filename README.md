# Invoice-management-system-task
# Invoice Dashboard Application

This is a React-based dashboard application for managing invoices. It allows users to view, filter, approve, and pay invoices. The application uses a backend API for fetching invoice data and includes modal pop-ups for approval and payment actions.

## Features
- **View Invoices**: Displays a list of invoices with client names, amounts, and statuses.
- **Search and Filter**: Search invoices by client name or amount, and filter by invoice status (approved, pending).
- **Approve/Pay Actions**: Includes buttons for approving and paying invoices, which trigger a confirmation modal.
- **Responsive UI**: The dashboard is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Backend API**: The application expects a backend API running on `http://localhost:5000/api/invoices`. You can adjust the API URL in the code if needed.
